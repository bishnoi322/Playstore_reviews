It is explained in deatil in the [article](https://medium.com/@bishnoi.kanchan4141/google-playstore-app-reviews-2eeda2a1dbfb)In this project, I aimed to assess the immediate impact of public response on product sales, focusing on online reviews as a key metric. Using a Google Play Store apps dataset sourced from Kaggle, I formulated analytical questions to explore app performance, user behavior, and market trends. Challenges in data cleaning, such as handling irregularities in the "installs" column, were addressed using Python's Pandas library. The analytical process involved answering questions through systematic data analysis, and the results were presented visually, primarily through graphs. Key findings include the prevalence of app ratings between 4.0 to 4.5, the influence of content and functionality on top-rated categories, and the correlation between app ratings and downloads. Recommendations were derived to enhance user experience, invest in top categories, optimize app features, prioritize efficiency in app sizes, and leverage utility-oriented apps. Technologies used include Pandas, Numpy, Kaggle, and Seaborn. For a detailed exploration.
