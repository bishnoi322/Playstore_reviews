# Objective
In this project, I aimed to assess the immediate impact of public response on product sales, focusing on online reviews as a key metric. Using a Google Play Store apps dataset sourced from Kaggle, I formulated analytical questions to explore app performance, user behavior, and market trends.

# Process
I started the project with the process of **data cleaning** including  identifying and replacing missing values, rechecking and making sure correct datatypes were being used for smooth analysis. After a throuogh process of data cleaning i moved onto the next process which is **data analysis** and was able to uncover meaningful insights.

# Insights
1. We find a prevalent rating range of 4.0 to 4.5, with categories like education and games consistently receiving top ratings.
2. A linear correlation between ratings and downloads plateaus at 4.5 to 4.8, suggesting user preferences. 
3. Additionally, smaller-sized apps tend to have higher download rates, reflecting efficiency preferences.
4. The dominance of utility-oriented apps, notably in the Tools category, highlights their influence on overall downloads. 
Through concise visualizations and analysis, our project offers valuable insights into the app ecosystem dynamics

# Improvements
Challenges in data cleaning, such as handling irregularities in the "installs" column, were addressed using Python's Pandas library. The analytical process involved answering questions through systematic data analysis, and the results were presented visually, primarily through graphs. Key findings include the prevalence of app ratings between 4.0 to 4.5, the influence of content and functionality on top-rated categories, and the correlation between app ratings and downloads. Recommendations were derived to enhance user experience, invest in top categories, optimize app features, prioritize efficiency in app sizes, and leverage utility-oriented apps. Technologies used include Pandas, Numpy, Kaggle, and Seaborn. For a detailed exploration.
